# My DMs with Adrian regarding idleRPG

Adrian decided to keep Jashsan, who catfished the whole server to believe he was 22 years old vs 16. I was hosting the bot for Adrian for a few good months. So I got kicked out when I said that I refused to work with him.

Also, fun fact, Adrian has been catfish twice since this has happened. The first time by Kitten Sushi and a second just this last month.
